# Martin Pulgar Construction Mobile App Test

This test is a take-home 23-hour test with an estimated 3 hours of work. The test will be sent to you at a certain time, and then the code will need to be returned via email 24 hours later.

## Project Description

Martin Pulgar Construction is a fictitious construction company. They have approached their IT department to create a new mobile app for their ground staff to upload photos. You are asked to build this app for them.

### Requirements

- App needs to have the design as per the provided screen designs.
- 1st functional button in this app is the ‘add a photo’ button, it will allow you to add photos on iOS and Android, it will then fill the site diary.
- 2nd functional button in this app is ‘Next’ button which will post the data and images to a web service.

### Technical Considerations

- Use Flutter 3.0 to build the app.
- You can use any state management (BLoC is preferred).
- Code needs to follow your best practices, including what you see as essential for enterprise-grade apps, e.g., unit tests, widget tests, or etc.

**Note:** Code will be evaluated not just for features but also on the quality of the code. Please put effort into maintaining high code quality.
