# DIARY
This is the sample application Diary of both web and mobile


Summary: This test is a take home 23 hour test with estimated 3 hours of work. The test will be sent to you at a certain time and then the code will need to be returned via email 24 hours later.
Martin Pulgar Construction is a fictitious construction company. They have approached their IT department to create a new mobile app for their ground staff to upload photos. You are asked to build this app for them. 
Requirements 
⦁	App needs to have the design as per the screen below
⦁	1st functional button in this app is the ‘add a photo’ button, it will allow you to add photos on iOS and Android, it will then fill the site diary 
⦁	2nd functional button in this app is ‘Next’ button which will post the data and images to a web service.
Technical Considerations 
⦁	Use Flutter 3.0 to build the app 
⦁	You can use any state management (BLoC is preferred)
⦁	Code needs to follow your best practices, including what you see as essential for enterprise grade apps, eg unit tests, widget tests or etc.
Note: Code will be evaluated not just for feature, but on the quality of the code too. So please put effort over there. 
Screen Designs
 

Web Service to post 2

Please use https://reqres.in/ to fake post the data and images (as base64 ).
